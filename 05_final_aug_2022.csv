I am currently under cronic condition nurse Brandi Richards. She is in Alabama and started with me before our health center got Erica. Brandi feels like a sister, eventhough I have never seen her. Her communication is awesome. 
All my dr""s, nursers, and care managers are the best I've ever seen in my life. I just wish there were some way they all could be recognized for the outstanding service they give to their customers.

The doctor we have been seeing seems very knowledgeable and caring.  I have been nothing but impressed and only wished we had switched long before we did.  When was the last time a doctor (not staff, not stuck in the exam room waiting, but the actual doctor) spent more than 10 minutes with you? Ours spends as much time as is needed to get a complete picture of an issue, diagnose, and explain...often in excess of 30 minutes.

Dr. McBrearty is also amazing with my 7 month old baby. He too goes above and beyond in doing everything right for her, so happy we have the best Dr for our kids within Everside. 

The only downfall is there isn't much locations around Littleton area with good female doctors. I have met Drs at Belmar and DTC location and they are nothing compared to Dr. Everett. Also, there isn't someone available at the front desk to answer phones frequently, will have to call a couple of times till we get to talk to someone.

I went to your office the week before for the blood work required and filled out some paperwork then.  I was also asked in an email online to fill out a questionnaire which I completed - much of the same information as I filled out manually in the office.

I then went to my appointment on the 3rd and checked in where I was told that no information was needed and they would get me soon.

This was very frustrating and she was a little unprofessional.

Five minutes later I was called into the exam room.  I has not finished my paperwork and had to finish during my exam.

When the nurse practitioner came in she apologized to me for having to fill out the forms twice - apparently they found the documents I completed the prior week.
