Jun-22," A last minute call by myself for a pre-op physical. Very accommodating with schedule, next day. Very cooperative, and professional, and thorough with exam. Follow up on communication to cardiologist was a little confusing with faxing information and numbers to my cardiologist. Not self explanatory very well to cardiologist. Improper fax number",Blood work and vaccine,IBEW Local 364 Health & Welfare Fund,Activate by Everside Rockford Family Medical Center,Extreme
Jun-22,"The Patient portal is somewhat of a nightmare. My Chart helped me have instant access to my lab reports and nurse practitioner. I Still don't have my lab reports and I had my labs done on Monday and my physical yesterday (Thursday). I called Everside customer service to explain the problem. I was told I would get a call back ""in a little while"" and it's 3 days later with no information. I Love Jennifer Messervy. She is an outstanding practitioner. The portal is TERRIBLE. I filled out questionnaires online (family history and medical history) before going and they asked for ALL the same info again and said it wasn't online. My labs are STILL not available to me and I cannot get anyone to help me.",Blood work and vaccine,Michelin - South Carolina,Michelin Family Health Center - Donaldson,Extreme

May-22,I am not receiving the same level of care as I was before. I am made to feel as a drug addict. The receptionists and the nurses were very courteous! I just don't feel like I am receiving the same level of care as I was before. I felt like I was dismissed when asked for a refill on medications that I have been taking for several years for pain.,Blood work and vaccine,Michelin - South Carolina,Michelin Family Health Center - Donaldson,Extreme
May-22," I was very appreciative of the time that everyone gave me.  I felt that they listened to me and also that I was also given medications that I needed.  After taking the medication over the weekend and some much needed rest, I am thankfully feeling much better, the horrible headaches are pretty much gone. Not that it is a bad thing, I would have liked a summary of my visit.",Blood work and vaccine,Buckeye Advantage - Bryan,Bryan Clinic,Extreme

Apr-22," I asked Dr. Song-Nichols to review my medical care from the last two years in order to transition to care to her because I was uncomfortable with my previous physician. She and the Everside clinical staff have been incredible, and I feel safer. Immediately after my initial appointments, I had a bad car accident. My treatments and the follow up provided have been exceptional. I am very glad I made the decision to transition to Everside Health!

Feb-22,Today is the 15th of February and I have yet to get a response to my concerns. It typically takes weeks to get a prescription refill. Feels like I donâ€™t matter to this group. Call was on time. My request was denied. Have yet to hear back about what could be done. I felt dismissed.,Lab result and services,IBEW Local 357,Union Family Health Center - Northwest,Extreme
Jan-22,Confusing communication. Treated rudely. Acted like we were interrupting them. Once it was determined my wife was positive for covid and I wasn&rsquo;t all focus went to her. I had more concerns about my blood pressure which is acting up and still is. Jump back and forth. Confusing Thanks to Covid you can no longer get personal health care anymore.
