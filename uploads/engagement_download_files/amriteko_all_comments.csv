It was frustrating not knowing to submit pictures of my ID in order to get the script I guess, I still don't know if that is what finally allowed my script to go through & the only reason I know it did was bc the pharmacy called.

My test came back positive.  She advised home instructions and sent prescription for the new anti-viral to my pharmacy. She has called me everyday, including over the weekend to check in.  Where else can you find a physician who cares that much? After 3 days on the medication I feel better.

1. The website doesn't actually allow scheduling appointments. When you go to the Schedule Appointments page, there's no way to do it.
2. As an alternative, I had to call, and there was no one answering the phone for several hours.
3. Following my appointment, I was instructed to first call the pharmacy to confirm that they had the necessary medication in stock before they could put in the prescription.

I am in a lot of pain and cant sleep and asked for a solution and all she kept saying is that I am not going to prescribe narcotics to you... i dont take medication unless its severe... she did no background, no relevant questions.... the doctor before that was the same... Ive been in pain for 3 months and the medicine the doctors prescribed i took once or twice and didnt help so i stopped and they didnt even care to ask what i was taking or why i stopped or anything.... I never go to doctors for this reason and the fact that all doctors always say there is nothing i can do without even understanding the real issues?  why do i waste my money and time?  why bother when i get 5 minutes with someone, pay all this money for them to say, you just want drugs and there is nothing i can do.  im crying every day because of how bad it hurts which is the only reason why i went to see a doctor.  the last time i saw a doctor before this pain was in 2019.. the time before that was probably 20 years ago... every time its the same thing where they make me feel like crap and dont want to help.  i dont even know why i tried. she sounded friendly at the beginning but after saying hello and i got your results, it just went straight down from there She was 10 min late and said she reviewed and saw slight inflammation but there is nothing she could do.  I asked for options and she said maybe an ortho but it will take awhile to schedule that and i told her i havent slept in 2 weeks, can she give me anything to help me sleep or ease the pain.. i told her that the anti-inflammatories gave me the runs and she snapped and said im not giving you narcotics... she accused me of being a drug addict and it got worse from there.... the narcotics that i got from quick care i never took... why would i ask for something that i would never take?  she did no background, nothing.... she just made me feel like crap",Blood work and vaccine,nan,Station Casinos Medical Center - Red Rock,Negative

The person kept telling me that I had COVID symptoms, when specifically stated I did not, nor had I been in contact with anyone who did. 
The ""appointment"" phone call seemed scattered. The person did not have any patient history and stated that she did not have access to my file. The person questioned my allergy to a certain medication and ultimately stated she would immediately call in a prescription to the pharmacy. 
Several hours later I went to a local pharmacy and they had no record of receiving any prescription. I immediately called the clinic and received a voice mail that they were closed. I left a brief message stating my displeasure that the prescription was not called into the pharmacy. Approximately 25 minutes later, after leaving the pharmacy, I received a call from the clinic stating that they ""need time to do notes"" and that they had just called the prescription in.

I was referred out to have a scan on my thyroid which came back showing a nodule. I received results in my UC health app, but since I am not a doctor, I was waiting for mine to call me with clarification on what everything means. However, my doctor told me she didn’t know what the results meant and usually it says more. I’m someone who is wondering about an abnormality on a scan and worrying myself only for my doctor to call me and tell me she doesn’t know. The appointment was a waste of time in that regard. I learned no new information and had to mention that if she didn’t know what a scan meant, then couldn’t she ask?

It seemed as if the doctor first called me and then read what the appointment was about. When she saw , she said” the cologuard was normal . And I don’t see the ultrasound. I’ll have to look and see if they were sent. She then went through a pile of faxes and then said I don’t see them. I’ll have to get back to you. Total time of the call was like 6 minutes. I waited for a call back for the next 15 minutes or so and then decided to give up on that.

Changing workers all the time so they do not know you. 

After going there for many many years they have no idea who I’am. 

I will be moving to another doctor where I can really feel supported and cared for. Greeted me Started 35 minutes late. 

Told me my labs would have to be done elsewhere as they did not have the supplies. After I asked them last week if they could complete my labs on 3 occasions . 

They never returned my call till 4 days later. 

They don’t always respond to messages on email. 

Sent me to lab corp where they were going to charge me 498.00 up front. 

I ended up Going to multicare yet had to go to 2 places prior so it’s exhausting. 

I fasted for this appt at 2 since night before at 6pm and didn’t get labs till 6 so I was behind shaking and exhausted.

Apr-22,"Experience was very average. Location is convenient, and Nurse Practicioner was patient/inquisitive. No review of my paperwork in advance, and there was an absolute lack of handoff between the nurse and treating APN.  Intake nurse asked, ""What brings you in today?"", and I spent 5-10 minutes in full conversation with her to describe issues - she appeared to take written notes, then left.  Then, APN came in and asked,"" What are you here about?"" - I asked him what nurse had shared with him, and he said, ""nothing.""  Bottom line is I told scheduler reason for appt, I wrote it on intake paperwork, I gave full detailed history to onsite intake nurse, and still had a treatment provider/APN who had no clue why I was there. 
 Next time, I will decline all questions until I see the doctor.

Apr-22,"Compare to what we had previously, I am not impressed with the people working in this medical office.   One EX:   This example pertains to my previous appt a few weeks ago, I had bloodwork appt at 7:45.  I was on time and waited, waited until about 8:15 before I asked the receptionist as to how long it will be as I had a 9 am appt.   She told me that the nurse was in heavy traffic and was running late.   She was already 30 minutes late.  In this case it would have been nice for the receptionist to notify me at 7:45 that the nurse was running late in case I needed to reschedule.   If a patient is late by 30 minutes, the patient is usually turned away/rescheduled.   

I learned that the nurse lives in Anderson and it was pouring down rain that day.  In this case, why would she not schedule to leave a little earlier.  I am sure she knows the traffic patterns when living so far away from her work and what rain does to traffic. Spent enough time to ask questions.

Apr-22,"What a hot mess this ""transition"" has been.  I have been a patient with R-Health for over 5 years and now have to re-do all forms and are not technically a patient because I haven't created a portal.  In the over 5 years I have been a patient I have NEVER waited to see anyone.  The hoops my doctor had to go through just to assign me a prescription was ridiculous.  Not to mention the fact that I was JUST in there a month ago for a full physical and we basically had to re-do it because of the disaster of the program Everside uses.  As a union member I encouraged MANY of my co-workers to go with R-Health and the experience I had on Friday was not worthy of that recommendation. You didn't do anything well.  The staff of R-Health Cherry Hill was stellar DISPITE the challenges they faced.  The nurses were very pleasant and professional and went out of their way to assist the confusion that this merger has caused.  My blood draw was one of the most painless I have experienced. And Dr. Handler was a delight and answered all my questions as always. What you didn't do well was take away Spruce which was a very easy way to communicate with my doctor.  You didn't create profiles for patients so that the transition was seamless for EXISTING patients. You didn't provide helpful assistance when I called customer service while I was in the office, because for some reason, you needed my social security number, which I refused to provide.  You have a very confusing customer service line which gives you options for hitting 1 and then doesn't present those same options when you actually hit the number.  You were not able to create an account for me, so that I could be treated by my doctor when I had difficulties signing in.

Apr-22," The provider took time to go over all my needs and addressed any concerns.

Staff did ask that I put one on (I had in my hand at the time) but another person in the waiting room did not have one on. Perhaps there was a medical reason for not making the other client mask but perhaps unmasked can go to a separate waiting area if masks are required? 
I spent 1 hour and 45 min in the office - most time was spent waiting. The staff was apologetic about the wait and I understand waiting is sometimes a necessity but my appointment (wellness visit) said it would take an hour, so maybe changing the expected time or letting me know things were running behind so I would be aware I would have some longer waiting times would be appreciated.

I seen the male doctor once and never wanted to see him again, and I seen Agee this time and don’t have any intentions to see her again.

He was generous with his time, he connected on a personal level, and he explained everything we discussed in a way I could understand. I came to this clinic because it was available to me through my work. I did not expect to find this quality of care, and I am very pleased to use Dr. Clifford for my primary care moving forward. The nurse who checked me in asked me a long list of questions, all of which I had already answered online (by the clinic's request) prior to my appointment. When I explained that, she said she did not have access to that information. I believe she then explained the situation to Dr. Clifford, and when he entered the room, he did have my previous answers with him. Again, the overall experience at the clinic and with Dr. Clifford exceeded my expectations.",Good doctor,SCIST,Monroe County Clinic,Positive

Apr-22,"I haven't yet had enough experience with the system to have formed a long-lasting opinion, but initial impressions aren't great.  The fact that Everside was not able or willing to import patient records from the previous system is impossibly stupid.  I can't imagine why someone decided it was acceptable to just *lose* every patient's data and have them start fresh.  Some patients have had issues for many years that they don't necessarily remember well enough to relate them to the nurse, but that can be critically important to know, and having that information simply disappear overnight due to poor data management is unforgivable.  Add to that the fact that neither the mobile app nor the website work correctly, and Everside hasn't exactly made a good first impression. Marva Thomas is an absolute asset to MHC and Everside as a whole.  She is to be accommodated in every way possible to keep her from taking her considerable talents elsewhere. I recognize reception work isn't exactly high-energy, but I would appreciate a touch more enthusiasm from the front desk.  As it stands, the staff handling reception have an attitude of boredom and ennui that makes it feel like asking a question, making an appointment, or making a mistake feel like an imposition, which isn't great for a public facing role.",Blood work and vaccine,Michelin - South Carolina,Michelin Family Health Center - Spartanburg,Negative

Apr-22,"I’ve been a patient of Dr Snyder’s for about 5 years and loved how she took time to listen and help me get to the root of my chronic health conditions. I really felt like she cared about me and helping me improve my health. The practice is now very regimented and visit consisted of being asked a ton of questions from a computer (which I could have done online myself) which left no time to have a conversation about what was going on or for me to ask questions that the questions raised. Not sure why the office made this change but it is not a positive one. (I realize it may have been mandated by Everhealth). In essence, to me the “million” questions is a barrier between patient and doctor - very clinical, regimented, and cold. As if purpose of visit is just to check off the checklist.
RHealth used to be set apart from other doctor offices/practices in terms of patient approach (which is how I heard about it - from a friend who very much appreciated Dr Snyder’s approach) but now it’s pretty much the same as others. As a woman with multiple chronic health issues, I need a practice that can take time to listen to and talk with me, not spend the visit asking a ton of questions off of a computer. If there’s some reason why all those questions need to be asked and answered, why not have patients do it online before the visit so there’s more time to engage in conversation during the office visit. Everyone was very friendly and respectful. See note above.",Blood work and vaccine,State of New Jersey - (Horizon BCBS),Cherry Hill Health Center,Negative

Apr-22,"It is easy to get an appointment at Trailhead Clinics. However, the last 2 times I have gone to Trailhead for something, it did not have the supplies necessary for the treatment I was seeking. They did not have on hand the birth control I was requesting (an IUD), and had to order it. The second time I went for an infection, the culture kits they had to test for it had expired, so they could not test to confirm my infection. So while I would recommend them as an additional resource for when other healthcare providers can't get you in and you have something more urgent you want to be seen for, there's at least same-day appointment available, but they may or may not be able to actually help you.

Why is it that people can get pain pills that don’t need them but me who don’t take meds unless I need to can’t get 2 to get me through until that medication starts working. The shot was gone by 9 pm so have been suffering with this ear ache ever since. To me that’s not good patient care.

Mar-22,"I love the staff at Everside however, the timing of getting things taken care of like a KISX card procedure is not good at all. Kate was very professional and concerned with my care. I went in on a Thursday afternoon at 2:30 and had blood clots in a hemorrhoid that felt that glass was rubbing together. They were to contact the Kisx people for me to have it removed. Kisx called me on Tuesday morning around 10:30 to get something scheduled. They told me that the order was faxed over Monday evening at 5:00pm.  This timing is unacceptable when you have blood clots and are in extreme pain. Fortunately I was able to already get into a surgeon on Friday and get the blood clots excised through my family who works in healthcare.  When I threw my back out back in December it took weeks to get my MRI scheduled through Kisx and I had to call Everside because they never sent the order in.

My height was asked for instead of measured. Previous company also had us verify all measurements written down as well as the name on the vile of blood taken. Not the case at Everside. Nurse Practitioner spent a good amount of time with me explaining how Everside works as opposed to other health care options. Did not like the fact that person drawing blood had an exposed pointer finger. I regret that I didn't make my concern known to this person. Full gloves should have been worn.

Mar-22,"I received an email at the beginning of February inviting me to participate in a wellness visit. The email offered a $50 Amazon gift card and I thought it was a good time to try it out. When I arrived for my appointment, the front desk nurse was unprofessional and I did not feel welcome at all. She had a mask on hanging under her nose. I was nervous and anxious and she did not help much. I received an email a few days before the appointment with several mental health related questions before the visit and I answered them and submitted them at that time. When the nurse took me to the room, she started asking me the same questions from the e-mail and I told her that I had just answered these questions in an email a couple of days ago. She did not know about this, so I finished answering the questions. After the questions, she asked me what medication I am taking and I responded that Lexapro is the only thing I take. She asked me why I take it and I said for anxiety and depression and she said that the questions I just answered did not match up with anxiety and depression. I responded that is why I take the medicine, it works. There were some other odd interactions that are difficult to explain in a short and written way. The normal nurse practitioner  .... Amber Apple ... was not there. A floater NP took care of me and she was ok. I was able to get a free refill on my Lexapro, which was nice, but overall the visit was weird and I will not be returning.

Mar-22," Caring, professional, thorough with follow through. It seems like since change to Everside, supplies used in routine services and Rx inventory are negatively impacted. Ex. With taking blood thinners, a blood draw needs more than a cotton ball and bandaid to help until the bleed stop. Previously they would use a self adhesive wrap. This wrap is only about $1 per roll at the dollar store, on Amazon, even through pet supply outlets. Also many meds are in short supply causing patients to make trips back to the clinic because inventory is short or depleted. This makes the “new” clinic appear cheap. When a clinic appears cheap you begin to question your care. Fortunately the staff is a known and trusted variable.",Services,Unified Group Services,Anderson Clinic,Positive

3. The check-in person attempted to give me paperwork to fill out, but when I mentioned I had completed some on line, she pulled certain papers out of the packet for me to fill out.  She should have known what she did and did not need.
4. The nurse failed to take my temp and blood pressure while she took down other information prior to my appt. with the doctor.

The reason my score was as high as it was is that I really like Dr. Browne. Dr. Browne took a good amount of time with me, and was very personable. Please refer to previous answer.  (Nurse didn't complete all tests prior to Dr. coming into the room & check-in person attempted to get me to fill out paperwork I had already done online.
NOTE:  The online appt. system should allow you to make your appt for your blood draw.  After making my online appt, I still had to call to schedule to get my blood drawn.",Appointment,Michelin - South Carolina,Michelin Family Health Center - HNA,Negative

The problem/disagreeable part is that Everside “lost” our records during the start up with Michelin so our health care folks had none of our history.  I, as the patient, had to locate my past information for them so they could properly do their job.  My guess is that not all patients could do that (nor should have to).  The transition to Everside has not been a positive first impression. Everything went smoothly and the staff and medical team were friendly, professional, and instilled confidence. Patient records were “lost” during the transition to Everside.  So I as the patient had to try to retrieve that information through My Chart.  My healthcare provider was helpful but neither of us should’ve had to do that.  Everside should have already had patient information transitioned.

He at one point interrupted me when I was trying to help him understand what I was saying. Instead, he was so focused on a panic attack as the source even when I tried to explain that I am not stressed, am the happiest I have been, and not feeling anxious one bit.  My vocal cord dysfunction can be caused by stressful situations, but it is also triggered by physical pain or activity, like running.

So I now need to make another appointment and go through this again to have my skin looked at.. not fair at all for Patient . Maybe this clinic needs to rethink the employees and look out for the patients that have to rely on this clinic as their only physician care they have..  It's a drive for us to travel to the clinic and I would appreciate that my time and appointment be taken a little more  seriously.  I was  told to wait for blood work.....took too long again waiting for nurse. 3:26 They did blood work BUT forgot to give me my flu shot. Maybe the staff should not talk to.one bother while they are with Patient. Maybe I would have received my flu shot or not . I
If a patient is asked to be on time or you will have to reschedule WHY WHY SHOULD I WAIT THAT LONG ?  The staff at our clinic never has been the best but this time was awful and wrong.

Feb-22,"My experience yesterday was less than desirable. Thanks to a float nurse. Upon arriving, I discovered my coat was on inside out. So I was fixing it and got distracted and forgot to put my mask on. Came in had a nice conversation with the front office lady. Who is wonderful. She took me back took my vitals and put me in a room. The nurse came in. Took one look at me and her whole demeanor changed. She said Put your mask on. Please, and please was definitely an afterthought. I got mine out of my purse to put on. She said no you need a surgical mask. I said this has always been fine in the past. She said no all the patients have to wear a surgical mask. Very rudely. Do you want me to get you one? I said no I’ll just leave.
1) She was not wearing a surgical mask. It was a paper one. 
2) I will not tolerate people talking to me like I’m their child. 
3) My mask has been fine for the last 2 years.
4) If you want people to wear those kinds of mask (which have not scientifically been proven to work) then you should have them outside the door.
5) I was only there to talk. Her chair is more than 6 feet away from where I was sitting. She was not going to touch me in anyway. So there was no reason whatsoever for her overdramatized attitude. 
6) If anyone there should have had a problem with it, it should have been the person taking my vitals. She actually had to touch me. I’m sure she would have spoken to me in a much nicer manner. 
7) The mask mandates, (Which are not laws) have been lifted for everyone except healthcare workers. I am no longer a healthcare worker. However I had no problem putting on a mask to pacify her. It was the way she told me I was going to have to or else. 
8) Without patients, she has no job. 
9) I have been vaccinated. So either they work or they don’t, The front desk lady is awesome. Always friendly and personable. Already explained previously.",Testing and Treatment,Major Tool And Machine,Major Tool Clinic,Negative

In my opinion, The value of Everside Health has increased  because of his bedside manners, hoe thorough he is, what a good listener he is, how sympathetic and considerate he is. He comes across as knowing and loving his career choice. Being a doctor is his true calling, because he is good at it!!! Prior to having Mr. Zeller as my doctor, I was ok with the service, but had I changed job location, I would have found another primary, if not sooner. As long as Mr. Zeller is there, I will be a patient. If he relocates, and not to another state, I would drive the distance.

I will not be seeing her anymore and if I cannot see another doctor at this clinic or another one, I will be finding a new place for my medical needs.

Feb-22,"NP did not wash hands before entering the exam room nor did she wash them after the exam or before leaving the room. Her disposition was often exhibited as not sure of what to do or what I am doing. Kept asking the question over and over to herself during the exam, ""What is that?"" When the nurse asked if a culture should be done, after several times asking, the NP replied, ""May as well, what the heck!""  Not very assuring for the patient. At one point she said to the patient, I don't know if I have enough for a culture, I don't want to hurt you. I told her several times, she wasn't hurting, me to please do what needed to be done to get what was needed, otherwise, the visit is futile, we don't want to have to repeat this. I just felt like that was not the best method to approach a medical situation or a first-time patient. With the pandemic in force, washing hands before examining a patient should be a required practice. It doesn't matter if you put on gloves, wash your hands before doing so ever time.

Jan-22,"This was my first visit after having a few bad experiences with my last doctor.  Thus far, I have found this doctor (Jeffrey Peterson) to be competent, compassionate, and understanding.  He appears to take a bit more holistic approach than just &quot;Here, take pill X for symptom Y&quot; and actually spent the time necessary to get the whole picture of the issue.  I hope this experience is the norm, in which case this rating will easily become a 10.  So far I&#39;m impressed...but having dealt with the US medical industry in recent years, I&#39;m still cautious. Almost everything.  Scheduling an appointment without having to wait week(s) for an open time slot was good. Staff was courteous.  Doctor listened to my concerns, took good notes and explained things very well.  Doctor spent more time with me in this one first appointment than I think my prior doctor spent with me in all 6 of the appointments I had with him before I gave up and decided to give Everside a try.  They actually read and used/understood the forms and information I filled out before the appointment (prior doctor would make me fill out online forms and then fill them out again in-office anyway) so in-office intake was refreshingly easy/quick.  Appointment started on-time and I did not feel like I was being rushed through just to collect a visit fee (unlike last doctor). So far, I&#39;m very glad I bailed on my last doctor and gave Dr. Peterson a try.  My hope is that my initial experience continues. Initial scheduling was difficult.  Most online scheduling options resulted in a &quot;teleconference only&quot; option and I knew an in-person visit would be required. Would be nice if there were a few more options online or an explanation that the tele-visit is free and may result in an in-office visit being scheduled (if this is the case). I tried calling the office, but only got voicemail (did not leave message since I was a new patient and that didn&#39;t seem right).  

When I first arrived, the receptionist/nurse/tech (not sure her exact role...she seems to do several) was not wearing a mask in accordance with COVID health regulations when she came up front.  When I asked, she said no one was there and she left her mask at the reception desk and did put it on once she got to it...so I can understand not wanting to wear it if you are healthy and no one is around.  This is a bit of a nit-pick...but I&#39;m honestly having a hard time coming up with much that wasn&#39;t done well related to this visit.",Blood work and vaccine,State of Colorado,Northglenn Metro North Clinic,Negative

Jan-22,They switched companies and now can&#39;t ever send me to the same Dr or practitioner twice in a row. Had issues with them telling my company that I said i didnt want to wait in line for civid test. Everside ran out of swabs for covid test. Found out when I got to my appointment so I had to schedule another test elsewhere ended up being a week after. I told Everside nurse I have intoxalock installed in my car and my car kept dying because i didbt have the breath to keep blowing in it to keep car running every 3 mins plus the clutch was even hard to push in. I was that sick. Extremely hard to catch my breath. Someone from Everside told AEIL that I said i didbt feel like waiting in line. Then they said I wasn&#39;t able to return to work until Tuesday yet tild my employer Friday. Might even lose my job over this. Can&#39;t get fmla cause it&#39;s all new doctors/nurse practitioners and nobody has seen me for my anxiety or depression and they can&#39;t read my file and nobody has seen me for my rotator cuff yet they have the dx and the MRI. It&#39;s been nothing but frustrating since it changed. Very nice and courteous over the phone and in person but then tell my employer other. Just upset and can&#39;t believe the way I was treated. Plus my phone isn&#39;t working and that was an issue as well because they&#39;re busy and can&#39;t receive calls only call when they can. That isn&#39;t their fault either.

Jan-22,"I&rsquo;m a fat lady (have been since I hit puberty). I intentionally asked the med assistant not to take my weight. She was great and honored my request. (I don&rsquo;t ask for this out of shame- I ask because medical research has consistently shown that intentional weight loss doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone over the long term between 95 and 97% of the time. Therefore I&rsquo;m not interested in a conversation about my weight). The doctor, however, without actually knowing my weight, decided to tell me on two separate visits that I needed to lose weight even though I did not request dieting or exercise advice from her and I insisted I would be consulting a dietician (which I did). Even after telling her that I would be consulting a dietitian AND without asking me anything about my diet and what I&rsquo;m actually eating, the doctor told me that I needed to &ldquo;stop eating so many carbs.&rdquo; (My cholesterol level was high, guess what probably caused my high cholesterol? A low carb, high protein diet). Would it kill medical professionals to treat fat people with a little respect? We&rsquo;re told every day of our lives by literally everyone that we are fat and therefore unworthy. Weight stigma in the medical profession is why I have (and why many fat people) stay away from doctors for so long that medical problems become untenable. While I may continue going to this doctor for now, I&rsquo;m seriously considering finding a new one. My lab results came back quickly. If you&rsquo;re treating a fat person who has respectfully asked not to be weighed and who has not asked for diet or weight loss advice, please do not provide any.
